			<p>According to <a href ="http://science.time.com/2013/01/24/goodbye-silicon-hello-dna-the-future-of-data-storage/">Science Time</a>:<br>"In 2011, according to the Digital Universe report, humanity had created 1.8 zetabytes of new data to store, around 1.8 trillion gigabytes. By 2020, the number is set to have grown 50 times over."<br>So what does this mean? In short we have an expontential growth of data, all of it needing a home, needing to be stored somewhere, but where? As our data grows, so does our need to make data storage smaller, denser, cheaper to prevent it from taking over our physical lives as much as it has our online lives!</p>

				<h1 class="topic_header">What is the state of data storage now?</h1>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>Data storage currently is dominated by magnetic data storage and optical data storage; magnetic data storage uses a magnetized medium to use different patterns of magnetization data to store data and is used for computer data mass storage. Optical data storage uses light pointed at various angles onto the material storing data (often aluminium) to read that data; common forms include CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray and other larger volumes such as PCD(Protein-coated Disc), some of which can hold up to 50TB.</p>
				<p>Data Centers are also a huge form of storage that we access in order to use the internet, servers and systems, they house computer systems and other components such as backup power supplies, fire suppression and air conditioning (to keep all the electronic equipment cool). Such facilities include Google's data centers in Iowa, Finland and Oregon:</p>

			<img class="blog_images" src="http://awesome.good.is/transparency/web/1009/the-world-of-data/transparency.jpg" alt="data we create"><!--insert images-->
			<p>Companies using data centers have a few issues to face, firstly as digital information grows, the need for bigger data centers arises, but if those data centers are physically limited on space, where do they store information once they out grow their current data center? Seondly aside from the size of a data storage facility you have the running costs to consider; no company wants to pay over the odds for a facility, but power and cooling costs are a crucial part of data storage facilities (such as those at Google) and are a huge expense. As quoted from <a href="http://searchvirtualstorage.techtarget.com/How-to-fix-data-storage-problems-created-by-server-virtualization">TechTarget</a><strong>"Storage currently accounts for 33 to 70 cents of every dollar spent on IT hardware."</strong> So how can these costs be cut?</p>
			<p>On a personal level of computing, people everywhere have their lives digitally stored: from address/phone books to photos, videos, personal memories and much more, as people are starting these digital collections at an earlier and earlier age how much storage might they require for a lifetime? Where will they store it? As technology advances will older data storage devices be accessible in the future?</p>

				<h1 class="topic_header">Potential future solutions</h1>
				<img class="blog_images" src="http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA2LzEzLzU0L2RuYS40NjE1MC5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxMjAweDYyNyMKZQlqcGc/54ec3455/275/dna.jpg" alt="DNA"><!--insert images-->
				<p>DNA could be the future solution, and by future I mean <em>future</em>! Storing data to DNA, believe it or not, has actually been tried, tested and successful. A couple of genomicists (a geneticist whose speciality is genomics, genomics being the study of genetics focusing on DNA) were sat in a bar in Hamburg discussing DNA, the conversation moved onto how to handle and store all the data their institution was creating, jokingly they said that DNA might be the way to go. Eventually this led to some testing and collaborating and resulted in using DNA to "<strong>store a complete set of Shakespeare&#39;s sonnets, a PDF of the first paper to describe DNA&#39;s double helix structure, a 26-second mp3 clip from Martin Luther King, Jr.&#39;s &quotI Have a Dream&quot speech, a text file of a compression algorithm, and a JPEG photograph of the institute</strong>". It was also retrieved with a 100% accuracy rate.</p>
				<p>Ok, so amazing, we've accurately stored a heap of stuff in DNA, its tiny, takes up no space, doesn&#39;t need air conditioning or fire precautions, why isn't this a plausible way to store data currently? Well its time consuming, expensive and requires a DNA sequencer to open the files which in the above case took two weeks to open! Although, the price of making and sequencing DNA is falling and continuing to do so, the price may not be such a problem in the future. On the other hand even if it becomes cheaper and faster, DNA is not rewritable (thankfully for humans!) so you would have to repeat the whole process to update the information stored and it doesn't allow for random access; you can't access only one of the files without decoding all of them.
				</p>
				<p>As previously mentioned DNA wouldn't require fire precautions, cooling equipment etc, but it does need to be kept in a specific environment for example -20C for short term, 4C for longer term, or at a specific PH level depending on the term of storage, in general a cold, dry, dark place. This does not mean that all data centers are suddenly going to become fridge-freezers for encoding, storing and decoding DNA, its not a realistic approach at the moment.</p>
				<p> A positive in the longevity of DNA is that because it doesn't have to be re-recorded (unlike magnetic tape which needs replacing every 5 years) it would be cheaper to record data on DNA if you wanted it to last 600 years than having to re-record the magnetic tape every 5.</p>
				<p>Finally DNA data storage is currently estimated to cost $12,400 per-megabyte to encode and $220 to decode/retrieve. On this note I will conclude that currently DNA data storage is not a feasible way to start storing data en masse but if the costs fall, as they are predicted to do, it may become plausible to store data that is not needed in the short term.</p>

				<p><em>"Electron microscopic image of an antiferroelectric crystal, with the dark, prominent diagonal lines marking the boundaries. The bar at the bottom left indicates a length of 200 nanometers."</em></p>
				<p>Domain walls could be the answer to our data storage question as they allow the tinies of spaces to store data; domain walls separate areas in certain crystalline materials and display a polarization which has the potential to allow data to be stored here, in the smallest of places. To put this simply an international team of researchers found that certain areas of antiferroelectric crystals (which normally possess no electrical polarization) exhibit ferroelectric polar properties. Ferroelectric materials are used to store data on such things as the strip on a train ticket and can be altered using an external electric field. See <a href ="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140114114253.htm">science daily</a> for further in depth information.</p>
				<p>The domain walls they were researching are only around 2 nanometers thick, if these could be used to store data in the future this would greatly reduce the physical space needed to house the storage-one tenth that of what magnetic material use to store data currently. This would solve outgrowing the physical space issue and also save on costly services,such as cooling as ferroelectric materials will retain its information without any electrical current running through it, and will use less energy thus making it a cheaper storage option.</p>
				<p>Further investigation is required into domain walls in crystalline materials but it seem a likely candidate over DNA data storage due to cost and ease of use rather than having to create DNA.</p>

				<p>There are already plenty of ways to transfer old data formats to newer ones, such as VCR to DVD, cassette tape to CD (and even then from CD to digital format on a computer). As technology advances so will the need for technology to retrieve outdated data formats, surely there will be a niche in the market if in twenty years time we can't just plug and play with old USB sticks or hard drives? Perhaps the previously mentioned DNA storage could be more applicable for personal items of data: you email the DNA storage company with your data, they encode it into DNA and then post out to you the encoded DNA, you now have this safely stored long term. Of course getting the data back off it and how quick/useful this might be is questionable but it could also be used as a type of time capsule stored in DNA which could be kept intact for thousands of years.</p>
