			<h2>My Favourite Websites</h2>

			<h2 class="topic_header">Considering the design of my favourite websites</h2>
			<p>I have chosen the following websites as my favourites for various different reasons, some provide me with time consuming interesting snippets off the internet that don't really give me anything than something to find myself doing, others give me an educational resource which may not necessarily reflect the design of the site but that's not what is most important to me when using those sites.</p>
			<p>In no particular order the following are my 'chosen ones'</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/serengeti-lion/index.html#.U5K5FpS1YRc" target="_blank">The Serengeti Lion</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.theverge.com/" target="_blank">The Verge</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/home" target="_blank">StumpleUpon</a></li>

				<h2 class="topic_header">The Serengeti Lion</h2>
				<img class="blog_images" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2915/14362884652_dc2d729bb9_o.jpg" alt="Serengeti Lion" alt="Serengeti homepage">
				<p>This site is just aesthetically so engaging and beautiful, I love it for the sheer allure of the images and videos of the lions.</p>
				<p>The homepage of this site is not specifically different from the rest, unlinke most websites with use the first page to be able to navigate around and then you can refer back to the home page to go onto another area of the site; Serengeti Lions gets straight into the content on the homepage inviting you to explore. The eye is lead from the moving images in the background to the naviagtional arrows and buttons.</p>
				<p>The Serengeti Lion project is aiming to educate people on the plight of lions, how it needn't be necessary for them to become extinct. I think this aim is reflected in the aesthetics of the page: simple, beautiful, captivating, as well as being navigable and slick. This lets the images speak for themselves to highlight the cause of the lions and make them the real focus point.</p>
				<p>The simplification lets the viewer take in the serious side of the project whilst they can relish in the beauty of the videos and images, it is very easy to change from each group of photos and back again, letting the viewer control the flow of pages they go to. The content itself uses images rather than words, with the addition of the About button which gives a concise explaination of the project with outside links for further reading.</p>
				<p>My final feelings on this website are that the viewer comes away more curious than before to learn about the lions cause and possibly wowed by the stunning imagery. The focus and content are very well put together visually but could possibly do with a little more information to engage the viewer with some reading rather than just images; although I think the style that has been chosen does convey their message effectively and reflects the cause, mostly because it is the kind of website people are likely to want to share with people...what could a cause wanting to help stop the extinction of lions ask for?!</p>

			<h2 class="topic_header">The Verge</h2>
			<img class="blog_images" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2904/14364605165_4fcbbbe379_o.jpg" alt="The Verge Homepage">
			<p>I primarily use The Verge when I have spare time (not so much anymore!!) and want to learn a little something in any area of tech. There is always something new to learn or read about that I've never heard of or was unaware was happening. They cover anything from product reviews, upcoming technology releases or rumoured releases to science and design, the content is varied, educational and quite often opionated.</p>
			<p>Five to seven different sized squares containing headlines make up the main part of the homepage, with a navigation bar just above them, the larger the boxed headline is the more you are naturally drawn to it. This allows the site designers to promote specific content to the user by making it bigger and taking up more of the homepage. I don't like the way the boxed headlines have semi-opaque background colours with images beneath them as I'm not sure whether the colours are supposed to be part of their website theme or there to draw you to the brightest colour, the images seem to lose their importance in a coloured blurry afterthought.</p>
			<p>The verge has a fairly busy, structured and uniformed home page, it <em>is</em> simple but with perhaps too many simple features crowded together. I guess this is just personal preference and as the web has been growing so has the popularity of trending websites, included are website designs, all of a sudden a lot of websites in the same genre seem to be fairly similar to each other; nav bars at the top that are always there when you scroll down or similarly also with sidebars. The navigation bar is of this type and therefore available from every page on the verge, making for easy movement through the pages with search included to make it extra easy and fluid.</p>

				<h2 class="topic_header">StumbleUpon</h2>
				<img class="blog_images" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3894/14178172417_11d81e6d9e_o.jpg" alt="StumbleUpon Homepage">
				<p>The premise of StumbleUpon is for you to give StumbleUpon a list of your interests and in return it will return pages from accross the web with relevant information on topics or if you say chose 'Funny stuff' if would return anything that might be classed as funny. It does this within its own site; leaving the 'Stumble' button and nav bar at the top of the page and then embedding the returned web site in the body of the page.</p>
				<p>I can always find something that interests me on hee, although I probably spend far too long each time getting lost from tangent to tangent! There are some useful and educational things but because it randomly generates your next website you can also spend an entie evening looking at unrelated material that wont further anything than the amount on time spent procrastinating on your computer!</p>
				<p>Up close the homepage takes your attention to the row of 4 images with small headlines and/or captions, individually coloured to identify them with the area of interest (that you choose in your settings-yes you have to sign in to do this). Further away you eye is drawn up to the black simple bar with clickable links to pages about activity, trending pages and lists. The simplicity gives the viewer ease of use, as is the same with the idea of the website, you say what you like-they give you content on what you like. I think if the focus and design of the website match each other it provides a more cohesive experience, StumbleUpon in my opinion accomplishes this. It is user guided so you feel like you are in control of what you are viewing rather than someone designing the site to draw you to what they want you to see (although how are you in control of a randomly generated website popping up in your screen?! But you know what I mean).</p>
				<p>When I feel I have spent far too many hours, and a bit, and finally remove myself from the latest mind-blowing puzzle site or the facts of wine site I'm never going to remember next time I have a glass of red in my hand, I feel that yes I have wasted a lot of time trawling through internet trivia. But the best part of StumbleUpon is that you can find some incredible material that you mightn't have otherwise come accross</p>
