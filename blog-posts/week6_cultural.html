			<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
			<br>
			<h2 class="topic_header">What is stereotype threat?</h2>
			<p>Stereotype threat denotes the risk of conforming to a negative stereotype about that persons group. If a group has a negative stereotype, a person who identifies themselves as part of that group may actually subconsciously perform in line with that negative stereotype.</p>
			<p>For example if a woman is told she will be tested on her driving ability compared to a man, she may encounter the stereotype threat that she will be viewed through the negative stereotype of women being bad drivers and thus under perform due to “subconscious self-handicapping”.</p>

			<article>
				<h2 class="topic_header">When have I experienced stereotype threat?</h2>
				<p>Of course most women per the above example have experienced some sort of ‘woman driver syndrome’ where a male counterpart may joke that you can’t park your car in the small space or of course you won’t pass your driving test first time.</p>
				<img class="blog_images" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zrfNFAnpN4M/Us0Ow6EpbSI/AAAAAAAAQmo/Hl9yI9D5H-s/s1600/funny-tiny-car-parking.jpg" alt="tiny car tiny space">
				<p>Although I have experienced those stereotypes I wouldn’t say it affected my achievement; I did pass my test first time and yes I can park in that ridiculously small parking space!</p>
				<p>On this note you really should check out <a href="http://nihonshock.com/2010/08/how-to-park-your-car-in-japan/">this</a> page I just found when persusing suitable car parking images!</p>
				<p>Part of this might be due to going to a girls school, in this environment the male counterparts are removed, on the other hand they are also replaced with different stereotypes within the female population: “popular girls” only caring about their looks, who they are friends with, “geeky girls” being uncool/having no friends, “pretty girls” being stupid, having no intelligence.</p>
				<p>Other stereotypes I have come across personally have been linked to race, being “English”/“British”/“Pommy” etc must mean that I am stuck up, love queueing, LOVE the weather(!), career, being a “hospo worker” must mean I have no goals, no academic abilities etc. (On the latter, well I’m here, right now, part of this crazy roller coaster course, so yes, I DO have goals!)</p>

			<h2 class="topic_header">How has stereotype threat affected me?</h2>
			<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
			<p>In fact looking at these stereotype which at times I may have fallen into or identified myself with I don’t feel that I have under achieved because of these, almost the opposite. If I felt someone deemed me to fall under the “geeky” category I would just show that I actually had friends and we were cool, we could “hang” out just as well as the rest of them!</p>
			<p>And even if I had subconsciously performed to those preconceptions (e.g being geeky, achieving academically and being uncool) surely I would have achieved something more academically and possibly less socially, which is surely better?!</p>

				<h2 class="topic_header">How can we reduce the affects of stereotype threat?</h2>
				<p>Firstly we can place less emphasis on any stereotype, whether that be in a social, study or work setting. Removing any task descriptions towards a stereotype so that any stereotype is overlooked, disarmed, not invoked or eliminated.</p>
				<img class="blog_images" src="http://mydesignstories.com/admin/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/17.jpg" alt="disarming">
				<p>Such removals have been shown in studies, where placing any demographic enquiries related to the student at the end of the exam so that any feeling of stereotyping ideally won’t arise until after the body of the exam has been completed.</p>
				<p>Also putting emphasis that the particular stereotyped group is also part of a wider un-stereotyped group may reduce the affects. Lets put this in the EDA context; to avoid any females in the cohort suffering from stereotype threat (lets face it, IT <em>is</em> a male dominated industry, although thankfully this is changing) you could address them in terms of their achievement of being part of EDA as whole, part of Kereru cohort, rather than of a group of women who are in the cohort. This puts emphasis on the group identity of our cohort, which doesn’t suffer from negative stereotypes and so places the focus on the whole group being expected to do well.</p>

				<h2 class="topic_header">Feedback</h2>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>Feedback can be an incredibly useful tool but must be used carefully; in terms of stereotype threat studies have shown that the way feedback is provided can affect the perceived bias of the feedback giver, the students motivation and their identification with groups.</p>
				<p>Constructive feedback that states performance standards have been high but that the student is capable of meeting these high standards/expectations; this means the student is less likely to feel that the mentor/person giving feedback is being bias towards any group the student may identify with, and has been shown to increase motivation.</p>
				<p>Also keeping in mind the idea of “growth mindset” (as mentioned in my <a href="/blog-posts/week3_cultural">Week Three Blog</a> on thinking styles) when writing/giving/receiving feedback may help lessen the level of stereotype threat. If we believe that our intelligence is extendable and can grow with learning then surely any personally perceived negative attribute of a social stereotype can also change and grow with more learning and challenging.</p>

				<h2 class="topic_header">Conclusion</h2>
				<p>Well yes, I was born in the United Kingdom, I am not stuck up but yes like the best of us I do love meteorology, so if you engage me in any small talk you must be prepared! Bring an umbrella-when it rains it pours.</p>

				<p>Finally, writing this blog post reminds me of a video I watch the other day, ties in quite nicely:</p>
