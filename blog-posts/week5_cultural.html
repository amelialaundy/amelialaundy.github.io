			<h1>Pairing & Giving Feedback</h1>
			<br>
			<h2 class="topic_header">Pairing & Feedback</h2>
			<p>The following are my personal responses to questions on pairing and feedback so far throughout phase zero at EDA, pairing for those reading this who are not part of EDA, is the process of working with someone else on one code, either physically at the same computer or over the internet using a collaborative application such as coderpad or stypi where you can both work live on the same document in a webpage.</p>

			<article>
				<h2 class="topic_header">What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</h2>
				<br>

				<br>
				<p>On reading about pairing pre-phase zero I didn’t create any expectations as such but wondered how hard it might be to pair with someone via the internet having never met them, not knowing their personality, personal situation or knowledge. After pairing even the first time I in fact enjoyed it, pairing came quite naturally and a short conversation between the both of us really helped to gauge where we both were on personal and academic levels. Seeing as we are all in the same boat in terms of experience in this field and pairing, we are all new to this and so can be comfortable in making mistakes together.</p>
				<p>At times I feel, if the challenge is easy, pairing slows the process down due to having to converse with someone else about what to write whereas you both might have written correctly straight away individually. Although the rest of the time, if the challenge is harder, I appreciate having another pair of ears and eyes to guide my mistakes or lack of knowledge on a particular section, these times pairing speeds up the process, as they say “two heads are better than one”.</p>

			<br>
			<p>On a few occasions pairing the task has been challenging but between us we have filled in where the other didn’t know quite what to do, slowly getting through and getting most of the test code to return true. These times the last test always returned false and became quite frustrating and had us going around in circles temporarily, but what became so rewarding was us working through these frustrations together, writing some (what I feel is) good code and finally returning TRUE for all test codes!</p>

				<h2 class="topic_header">Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</h2>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>I haven’t become frustrated with the pairing per say, rather the challenge we have been working through not returning what we intend or nothing at all, the same goes for working on my own, it’s the not knowing why it doesn’t work that is the frustration point, not the process of pairing.</p>
				<p>The most difficult part of pairing so far for me has been to keep to said roles (driver/navigator) rather than having a discussion, trying things each or going to google to research something and then collaborating on our conclusion.</p>

				<h2 class="topic_header">How did you feel when you read your feedback?</h2>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>Last monday I suddenly received all my feedback to date and had completely forgotten I would be receiving any, it was a great surprise! I felt humbled and happy to read these things people have written about/to me.</p>
				<p>I realise at this point of our journey in the pairing world we are quite new to pairing itself and the code we are writing so most of us don’t seem to have many actionable feedback for others, more just encouragement or appreciation for a good session. I think it may become more difficult when we start giving/receiving more actionable feedback, as we pair more and improve on our code knowledge, because you have to remember it’s not a negative to be taken personally but actually an advice on improvement to be embraced and used.</p>

			<article>
				<h2 class="topic_header">Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</h2>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>The setting of roles at the beginning of pairing sessions is something I definitely want to improve on, it’s slowly becoming more natural to have less of an unstructured chat/discussion and actually settle into being the driver or navigator.</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h2 class="topic_header">How was it to write feedback? What was most difficult?</h2>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>Writing feedback was an interesting process, as previously mentioned at this point I am finding it hard to give actionable feedback other than encouragement or to have faith in yourself. Also the anonymity side of the feedback was a struggle to understand, how anonymous does it need to be? Do I want the other person to identify me as the author? Am I supposed to be keeping my identity anonymous for the purpose of feedback? If this is so then I can’t be too specific about what we did. I personally don’t mind if the person I’m writing feedback for know it’s me so I try to be as specific as possible in relation to the feedback.</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h2 class="topic_header">Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</h2><br>
				<img class="blog_images" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/12/94735395_9eb1ef92fd.jpg" alt="ruby pairing"><!--insert images--><br>
				<p>As much as pairing provides feedback from an external source which <em>you</em> can gain from any insight given, I think when trying to give actionable feedback to others it makes me assess <em>my</em> own performance in pairing as well. I find myself thinking if I were writing feedback for myself, what would I recommend?</p>
				<p>Pairing has engaged me in different ways of doing the same thing and new ways of tackling specific code problems, it has made me realise that we all approach and do things differently and taking a little of others approaches may help you in your own learning.</p>
				<p>Finally, having a HUMAN to talk to about code and empathise with about our experiences in EDA so far has been amazing, I’m not sure how much more my friends/flatmates can smile and nod when I go into a code fuelled conversation with them!!</p>
