			<h2>CSS Positioning</h2>
			<br>
			<h2 class="topic_header">Relative, absolute and fixed positioning</h2>
			<p>Today I am going to explain the differences between the positioning of elements in HTML documents using CSS. I am covering position:relative, position:absolute and position:fixed.</p>
			<p>For those reading this who are not studying html/css, html documents contain the actual content you see on a page-images, videos, text, headlines etc. When you use CSS (cascading style sheets) in conjunction with an HTML document you can style the document to look how you want-positioning an image to the left of a paragraph, selecting text colours, fonts, sizes, how a link might look when you hover the mouse over it, literally anything!</p>
			<p>Lets start off with some elements on a page and call this the original position, with the default position of static:</p>
			<img class="blog_images" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5532/14423572985_39ecda346e_z.jpg" alt="orginal">
			<p>Image One</p>
			<p>Please not that the blue red and yellow paragraphs and <em>child</em> elements of the purple block element.</p>

			<article>
				<h2 class="topic_header">Position:relative</h2>
				<p>Setting an element to position:relative firstly means that the position is relative to <em>itself</em>, not the document or any other elements on the page.</p>
				Looking at image one above we are going to set the yellow paragraph three to position:relative, followed by instructions of where the position will be in relation to its orginal position. So lets set top:20px, this will move it 20 pixels from the top of where it was and left:-40px, this will move it to the left 40 pixels. This did confuse me as it was a negative 40 moving it to the left but if you think about its original position from the left it was at 0, to the right would be positive, so moving it to the left would require a negative number.

				<img class="blog_images" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3867/14236973510_01e28b1c4c_z.jpg" alt="position:relative"><!--insert images-->
				<p>Image Two</p>
				<p>There are two things to consider with position:relative; 	<ul>
						<li>firstly it makes the element appear <em>on top</em> of everything, even if you don't set a z-index value. Z-index sets whether the element will be shown onfront of or behind another element: an element with z-index 0.9 is higher than an element of z-index 0.1 and therefore the element with a higher z-index will sit infront of the element with z-index 0.1.</li>
						<li>secondly it limits the use of having position:absolute for a child element within the element with position:relative. This means that anything within element position:relative(the parent element) that is set to position:absolute will be positioned within the parent element rather than positioned within the whole document.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
			</article>

			<article>
			<h2 class="topic_header">Position:absolute</h2>
			<p>An element with position:absolute will be positioned exactly where you want it within the document(/page).</p>
			<p>Now we will move the yellow paragrah three to the top right hand corner of the whole page. To do this firstly set paragraph three to position:absolute with values top:0 and right:0 I have also set the width to 200px to demonstrate you can also change the size whilst positioning it.</p>
			<p>This will place paragraph three 0 pixels from the top and 0 pixels from the right of the page, thus putting it in the right hand top corner.</p>
			<img class="blog_images" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3859/14237118987_a0420e8bcf_z.jpg" alt=""><!--insert images-->
			<p>Image Three</p>
			<p>As you can see the paragraph is now 200 pixels wide and positioned in the top right hand corner. To consider:
				<ul>
					<li>As it is actually removing paragraph three from the document and repositioning it on it's own, the other elements around it have shifted, the purple block element is now only the height of the blue and red paragraphs, rather than leaving a blank purple part below them where paragraph three originally sat.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			</article>

			<article>
				<h2 class="topic_header">Position:fixed</h2>
				<p>Lastly position:fixed allows you to place an element, and keep it there, anywhere in the <em>browser window</em>, not the document.</p>
				<p>So back to the examples, I will move paragraph three to the left hand side of the page and keep it there (by keep it there I mean it stays in that position in the browser even when scrolling-some sites use this for navigation bars so that they are always there no matter where you are on the page). Firstly the element will be set to position:fixed, then as before to make it 0 pixels from the left and top of the page left:0 and top:0. I have also set the width to 250px and height to 500px to show what a sidebar might look like using fixed.</p>

				<p>Image Three</p>
				<p>Things to consider with position:fixed:
					<ul>
						<li>This can be a great tool to give the user access to a sidebar or navigational areas, although it does sit ontop of the other elements which you can see as the left hand side of block/paragraph one/paragraph two have been covered over with paragraph three.</li>
						<li>Also as you scroll to the bottom of the page, any footer information would also be covered by the sidebar</li>
						<li>Someone using a smaller screen or portable device such as a phone might also struggle with a fixed sidebar as it would cover alot more content on the page due to the smaller width of the device screen. These issues can be overcome but thought and testing does need to go into it.</li>
