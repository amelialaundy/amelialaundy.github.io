			<h1>Exploring My Values</h1>
			<br>
			<h2 class="topic_header">What are my values?</h2>
			<p>This week there are a few questions that make up this blog post, so I will paste them above each section for context.</p>
			<p>When you think of the times in your life where you’ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind? The following in bold are the ones I have chosen:</p>
			<p><b>Accomplishment</b> Accountability <b>Achievement</b> Activism <b>Adventure</b> Affection Ambition Autonomy Challenge Close relationships Commitment Community Compassion Competence Competition <b>Confidence</b> Conformity Control Coolness under fire Cooperation Courage Creativity Credibility Decisiveness Economic security Effectiveness Efficiency Enthusiasm Environmentalism Excellence Excitement Fairness Faith Fame Free time <b>Freedom</b> <b>Friendships</b> Growth Having a family Health Helping other people Helping society Honesty Hospitality <b>Independence</b> Influence Inner harmony Insight <b>Inspiration</b> Integrity Intellectual status Introspection Justice <b>Knowledge</b> Leadership Location Loyalty Meaningful work Mentorship Merit Money Movement Music Nature Openness Order Patriotism Peace Persistence <b>Personal development</b> Physical challenge Pleasure Power and authority Privacy Public service Purity Quality Recognition Reputation Responsibility Romance Security Self-knowledge Self-reliance <b>Self-respect</b> Serenity Sophistication Spirituality Stability Status Tranquility <b>Truth</b> Vibrancy Volunteering Wealth Will-power Wisdom</p>

				<h2 class="topic_header">Independence</h2>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</p>
				<p>Having and maintaining my independence is particularly important to me as its one of those thing you might not appreciate until its gone. Or on the flip side perhaps you don’t value you it until you gain it.</p>
				<p>Having independence doesn’t mean you can’t be <em>dependent</em> but rather employs you as an individual to take control of your circumstances and own them, rather than having them own you. You can still depend on your friends/family for support, but you also acknowledge that alongside that support you can actively live the lifestyle or achieve the goals that <em>you</em> set for yourself.</p>
				<p>I wouldn’t be where I am today had I not grown a lot independently from a young age; being capable of self sufficiency provides you with a sense of freedom and achievement, leaving no one but yourself to blame should things no go according to an idealised plan.</p>

				<p>How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?<br>Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at EDA?</p>
				<p>Looking at the values I chose I believe that they can specifically be used to combat stereotype threat and feeling down:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Acknowledging what achievement is for yourself, not anyone else, may help to balance the effects of stereotype threat so that you realise what you have personally accomplished in comparison to your own ability rather than the stereotyped ability of an identity group to which you may belong</li>
						<li>Having confidence in yourself or believing you have confidence sometimes is enough to give you real confidence, I guess kind of like a placebo effect where if you say “I am confident I can do xyz” and act like you can, it might possibly result in the opposite of stereotype threat and produce a natural confidence in the given xyz</li>
						<li>Freedom for me is very important, some might see it as being selfish, I see it as you are living your life for yourself, yes there are other people that will remain or come and go from your life and will be taken into account, but ultimately you are the only one who is going to be there for the whole race, employ some personal freedom: if you really want to do something, let yourself have the freedom to make that possible. We have all granted ourselves enough freedom that we are all part of the roller coaster that is about to take off in two weeks time, be thankful for this as not everyone has the chance to make their own freedom</li>
						<li>Friendships can be very important in regards to mediating stereotype threat and to help if you are feeling down. Friends are people you can turn to whenever you need them, it is always comforting to know you have them even if you can’t see them. Friendships can provide an outside source and in terms of stereotype threat may actually show you that they might be in the same identity group as you but they can overcome any threat caused by that, and so can you</li>
						<li>Inspiration can come from anywhere for anyone, thinking about how to combat stereotype threat, inspiration may come from those around you who are achieving their goals even though they may be stereotypically part of a group that society deems incapable of those goals</li>
						<li>Knowledge is a powerful tool, no one can take it away from you, nor can they objectively judge you on your knowledge as, for all they know, your knowledge is endless, just because you may not outwardly show it 24/7 does not mean its not there. (Sorry about the pun!) Perhaps when feeling down at EDA it might help to remember that although you might be feeling some people are more knowledgeable than you/better at doing something than you etc, there is always going to be someone who you can teach something to that they don’t already know</li>
						<li>Personal Development develops with experiences, age, people, a multitude of things can change how you drive yourself to develop on a personal level. As it suggests, it is a very <em>personal</em> thing, different for each and everyone one of us and although someone might thrive from setting specific personal development goals, these aren’t always applicable to all, there is no one size fits all. As you develop as a person, the things you want to further develop will also change and mould as you do</li>
						<li>Having self-respect I believe is attainable for everyone and should be on everyones value list. Without it how can you expect to earn respect, or even have true respect for others? Self respecting may also be about not beating yourself up if you fail and something, or you are overwhelmed with the difficulty of something, if you wouldn’t react to someone else failing at it, have some self and don’t beat yourself up</li>
						<li>Truth, possibly one of the most important of them all. To be true to your values, your friends and to the world is to be true to yourself. As previously mentioned, you are the only one who is going to be there for the whole race, if everyone practised truth, there would be no stereotype threat as no one would be grouping people by any perceived lack of skill or ability in a field. I always try to be as honest as I can with myself, once I can admit something inside it makes it a whole heap easier to admit it to others. Taking the EDA example, if you can be truthful and ask for help when you need it, and say when you can’t do something or don’t understand something, you will get further faster than not saying anything at all</li>
