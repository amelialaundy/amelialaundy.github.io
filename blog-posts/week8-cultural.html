			<p>The best examples of dealing with conflict are probably customer service based as I have been in this industry going on 7 years now. To talk about conflict I will use an example of a dissatisfied customer;
			realised until the food came out of the kitchen that it was incorrect.</p>
			<p>Now it also happened that this table had been waiting too long (in their eyes and mine) for their food to come out, and so when the order was wrong as well this created a lot of frustration on their half. On my side of things it was a double faux par-the wait for food is bad enough, especially when that is down to the kitchens responsibility in timing, but in the hospitality industry this always directly reflects on the server rather than the kitchen when it comes to complaining. The fact that I had by pure accident ordered the wrong item made me feel stupid and that it was going to be hard to come out of this on top!</p>

				<h2 class="topic_header">Dealing with conflict</h2>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>Handling conflicts such as this during service might be very different to how one might react to conflict with friends or family. You need to make it obvious that it is your fault(even if it isn’t), apologise profusely and in many cases offer an exchange/complimentary item to the customer.</p>
				<p>The customer was now just stating over and over again that it had taken too long and they had no time to wait for the correct order to be cooked, I felt in this case I had offered everything within my power but they were still dissatisfied and wouldn’t take any complimentary items to make up for it. My ultimate way of dealing with the situation was to ask if I could do anything else to make this better (which was curtly replied to with a no), apologise again and then to leave the situation.</p>

				<h2 class="topic_header">What creates conflict</h2>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>The source of this conflict was an action of mine, albeit not an intentional action. I always try to remember this when it seems a customer(or anyone else) is reacting as though you have made the mistake on purpose, as if you <em>wanted</em> to annoy them.</p>

				<h2 class="topic_header">Do your actions help to resolve conflict?</h2>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>I would describe my actions/reactions to the unhappy customer as calm, clear and aiming to be effective; this doesn’t mean that my actions could ever have made the conflict better, but they probably didn’t make it worse either.</p>
				<p>In these situations is really does depend on the customer you are dealing with and if you have built up a rapport with them since they have walked in. Building rapport beforehand may make it easier to deal with any conflict that might possibly arise later on, you can apply this to many situations, such as working with other people, once you have an understanding of each other and what each other might appreciate or not it can be easier to make up for any mistakes made on your part.</p>

				<h2 class="topic_header">What would you change next time?</h2>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>If I was to go back I don’t think I would change my actions. Each customer behaves differently due to personality, but you also don’t know whats going on in their lives right now; yeah you might feel personally attacked by their reaction but nearly all of the time is not the case, they might have been having a really bad day/week/month etc, they may have been given some bad news or be in a rush to get somewhere, or then again they might just be high maintenance people!!</p>

				<h2 class="topic_header">What did you learn?</h2>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>From this experience and many others I have learnt that just because someone else is reacting unfairly or stubbornly, retaliating in that way will only lengthen the situation and draw out any conflict; keeping calm and stating facts rather than opinions also helps to keep the line of objective vs subjective from blurring.</p>
				<p>Clear communication about how the situation came about can also help diffuse any disagreements if it is becoming opinionated and heated, for a customer it is better for them to hear “I’m sorry about xyz, it’s completely my fault because xyz, but I can offer xyz to you as an apology” than you trying to argue that its not your fault and you can’t do anything to make it better. Laziness sometimes leads to the latter, you can’t be bothered to go out of your way to check with your manager if you can give away a free coffee or take something off the bill for a customer, this makes the customer feel that you don’t care about resolving the conflict which is almost the opposite to a servers job description!</p>
				<p>You win some you lose some.</p>
