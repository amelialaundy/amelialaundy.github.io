				<h1 id="first_header">Haloumi cheese comes from south eastern europe, most notably Greece, Cyprus and Turkey.</h1>
				<p>I have always loved cheese, and in particular Haloumi,it always amazed me how you can fry a cheese without it turning into a runny fatty mess! </p>
				
				<p>So when I first set out on a mission to try and make cheese for the first time I thought 'hey, Camembert can't be too hard to make can it?!' oh how wrong I was... After ending up with 3 'camemberts' of varying putrified colours of mould from pink to dark green I took a step back and put down the advanced cheese making guide and accepted that I would have to start at the beginning..makes sense though I think?! That's how I ended up making Haloumi Cheese and succeeding!</p>

						<h1>What you will need:</h1>
						<ul>
							<li>5 litres of full cream milk-it must be unhomogenized</li>
							<li>6mls of rennet-vegetarian rennet is available and works just as well</li>
							<li>3 tablespoons of rock salt-it can't be iodised salt</li>
							<li>dried mint to taste</li>
							<br>
							<li>5+ litre saucepan to hold the milk</li>
							<li>1 x kitchen sink (no joke!)</li>
							<li>food thermometer</li>
							<li>colander</li>
							<li>thin teatowel or muslin cloth</li>
							<li>measuring spoons/jugs</li>
							<li>a knife</li>
							<li>slotted spoon</li>
							<li>seive</li>
							<li>cake cooling rack</li>
							<li>storage container</li>

									<ul>
										<li>Unhomogenized milk: Homogenization is a treatment done to milk that stops the fat from separating; pasteurization is when milk has heat treatment to kill certain pathogens. Making cheese with pasteurized milk is fine, it doesnt contain any bad bacteria but homogenized milk will not work as you need the fat to separate.</li>
										<li>Iodised salt contains iodine which kills rennet-not helpful in cheesemaking!!</li>

						<h1>Making the curds</h1>
						<ol>
							<li>Heat the milk to 34ºC and then add the rennet, stir well.</li>
							<br>

							<br>
							<li>Place the saucepan of milk in your kitchen sink and cover with lid, fill the sink around the saucepan with warm water to keep the milk at 34ºC, leave it at 34ºC for 30minutes.</li>
							<li>After 30 minutes a "clean break" needs to be formed; this is when the curd separates cleanly when you insert a knife in and pull it to the side gently. Leave longer if a clean break is not acheieved.</li>
							<br>

							<br>
						</ol>
						<h1>Processing the curds</h1>
						<ol>
							<li>To break the curds take the knife and holding at a 45º angle slice through the curds in one direction, then repeat accross the direction, and repeat once more cutting with the knife vertical, this produces small cubes in the curds. Leave to rest for 15 minutes and then agitate gently with the slotted spoon, leave to rest for a further 15 minutes.</li>
							<br>

							<br>
							<li>Heat the pan slowly to 38ºC, then replace the saucepan to the sink and keep at a constant temperature for another 30 minutes, the curds will expel more whey.</li>
							<li>Using the slotted spoon carefully transfer the curds to the colander lined with a tea towel/muslin cloth. Set the colander atop another pan to catch the whey that will expel from the curds. Save the surplus whey from the first pan as this will be used later.</li>

							<br>
							<li>Wrap the haloumi in the tea towel/muslin cloth and place a heavy weight on top to compress the curders and help expel more liquid, do this for 1 hour.
								<br>
								5kg is the recommended mass, a large pot of water should suffice.
							</li>
							<li>Slice the curd mass into wedges or slices, these should be the size that fit in your storage container.</li>
						</ol>
						<h1>Preparing the whey</h1>
						<ol>
							<li>Heat the whey left over from previously to simmering and add the salt. Any remaining milk proteins will know knit together and rise to the top. This is ricotta and is a by-product of haloumi.</li>
							<br>
							<img src="http://pad1.whstatic.com/images/thumb/5/50/Whey-Ricotta---Cooking.jpg/600px-Whey-Ricotta---Cooking.jpg" alt="Milk Proteins" width="500px">
							<li>Take the slices of haloumi and add them to the whey. Simmer until the slices start to float, then turn the temperature down and poach for 15 minutes.</li>
							<li>Now remove the slices and drain on the cake cooling rack. In the container add whey to fill about a quarter of the container and the dried mint. Add the haloumi slices to the container and top the whey up intil the slices are covered.</li>
						</ol>
						<h1>Storage and serving</h1>
						<ul>
							<li>The haloumi will be ready to eat straigt away although leave over night to infuse the mint. Store the cheese in the fridge.</li>
							<li>Haloumi can be fried and doesn't melt due to its low acidity. Alternatively it can be eaten raw too. Grilling is another option, grill or fry until golden brown.</li>
