			<p>According to <a href ="http://science.time.com/2013/01/24/goodbye-silicon-hello-dna-the-future-of-data-storage/">Science Time</a>:<br>"In 2011, according to the Digital Universe report, humanity had created 1.8 zetabytes of new data to store, around 1.8 trillion gigabytes. By 2020, the number is set to have grown 50 times over."<br>So what does this mean? In short we have an expontential growth of data, all of it needing a home, needing to be stored somewhere, but where? As our data grows, so does our need to make data storage smaller, denser, cheaper to prevent it from taking over our physical lives as much as it has our online lives!</p>

				<h1 class="topic_header">What is the state of data storage now?</h1>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>Data storage currently is dominated by magnetic data storage and optical data storage; magnetic data storage uses a magnetized medium to use different patterns of magnetization data to store data and is used for computer data mass storage. Optical data storage uses light pointed at various angles onto the material storing data (often aluminium) to read that data; common forms include CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray and other larger volumes such as PCD(Protein-coated Disc), some of which can hold up to 50TB.</p>
				<p>Data Centers are also a huge form of storage that we access in order to use the internet, servers and systems, they house computer systems and other components such as backup power supplies, fire suppression and air conditioning (to keep all the electronic equipment cool). Such facilities include Google's data centers in Iowa, Finland and Oregon:</p>

			<h1 class="topic_header">Problems facing data storage</h1>
			<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
			<p>Companies using data centers have a few issues to face, firstly as digital information grows, the need for bigger data centers arises, but if those data centers are physically limited on space, where do they store information once they out grow their current data center? Seondly aside from the size of a data storage facility you have the running costs to consider; no company wants to pay over the odds for a facility, but power and cooling costs are a crucial part of data storage facilities (such as those at Google) and are a huge expense. As quoted from <a href="http://searchvirtualstorage.techtarget.com/How-to-fix-data-storage-problems-created-by-server-virtualization">TechTarget</a> "Storage currently accounts for 33 to 70 cents of every dollar spent on IT hardware." So how can these costs be cut?</p>
			<p>On a personal level of computing, people everywhere have their lives digitally stored: from address/phone books to photos, videos, personal memories and much more, as people are starting these digital collections at an earlier and earlier age how much storage might they require for a lifetime? Where will they store it? As technology advances will older data storage devices be accessible in the future?</p>

				<p>DNA</p>
				<p>domain walls, which separate areas in certain crystalline materials, display a polarization, potentially allowing information to be stored in the tiniest of spaces, thus saving energy. </p>
				<p>data deduplication</p>
				<p>There are already plenty of ways to transfer old data formats to newer ones, such as VCR to DVD, cassette tape to CD (and even then from CD to digital format on a computer).</p>
