			<p>According to <a href ="http://science.time.com/2013/01/24/goodbye-silicon-hello-dna-the-future-of-data-storage/">Science Time</a>:<br>"In 2011, according to the Digital Universe report, humanity had created 1.8 zetabytes of new data to store, around 1.8 trillion gigabytes. By 2020, the number is set to have grown 50 times over."<br>So what does this mean? In short we have an expontential growth of data, all of it needing a home, needing to be stored somewhere, but where? As our data grows, so does our need to make data storage smaller, denser, cheaper to prevent it from taking over our physical lives as much as it has our online lives!</p>

				<h1 class="topic_header">What is the state of data storage now?</h1>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>Data storage currently is dominated by magnetic data storage and optical data storage; magnetic data storage uses a magnetized medium to use different patterns of magnetization data to store data and is used for computer data mass storage. Optical data storage comes in the form of CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray and other larger volumes such as PCD(Protein-coated Disc some of which can hold up to 50TB.</p>
				<p>Data Centers are also a huge form of storage that we access in order to use the internet, they house computer system and other components such as backup power supplies, fire suppression and air conditioning to keep all the electronic equipment cool. Such facilities include Google's data centers in Iowa, Finland and Oregon</p>
