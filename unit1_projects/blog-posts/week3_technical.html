				<h1 class="topic_header">Javascript as the future</h1>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>"As long as there are people using the internet, javascript will be alive" or something similar was a quote I came across the other day and this sparked me to really question the validity behind this prediction/claim because due to being a Javascript 'speaker' for approximately 6 <strong>whole</strong> days now I have no knowledge of the popularity or longevity of this language.</p>

			<p>I found <a href ="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/javascript-tops-latest-programming-language-popularity-ranking-from-redmonk/" >this</a> article on tech crunch whilst researching why javascript is so popular and was found the results of their ranking system to be quite succinct.</p>

			<p>Now you do need to take into consideration that it is difficult to determine qualitatively the popularity of a programming language, but these guys(RedMonk) have analysed the programming languages used in files on GitHub and data from the Q & A side StackOverflow so it seems to me a fair way to judge popularity. The results speak for themselves that Javascript is top of the list followed by Java, PHP, Python and Ruby (waheyy!) as the top 5. Ok, Javascript it seems is popular, but why?</p>
			<p>Possibly because of these reasons!</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>It's <strong>easy</strong> to learn!<br> Javascript is a flexible language, and comes standardized on most common browsers meaning that it is also far more useful.</li>
					<li>It is easy to edit (and cheap!).<br> Javascript is a scripting program so you dont need to compile it or buy expensive compiling software, you only need a text editor such as sublime text 2 that I'm using here.</li>
					<li>There are lots of tools available.<br>Browsers now have built in options giving pwer to the user, you can view and edit the javascript of your favourite webpage right there. For example the Web Developer Toolbar on chrome allows the user to test javascript without having to worry about savings, uploading anything.</li>
					<li>Debugging is easy.<br>With the tools available it is easy to debug javascript, you can trace back to the exact place the error occurred in the browser console.</li>
					<li>Javascript is easily extensible.<br> You cando complex things behind the scenes or manipulate the aesthetics with Javascript, but this can be very time consming and takes a lot of code to develop. So developers have written several libraries to support Javascript such as jQuery, Prototype and Dojo that allow and support Javascript to manipulate pages with only a few lines of code.</li>
					<li>AJAX makes Javascript even better!<br>AJAX (asynchronous Javascript and XML) allows browsers to request information from the server without leaving or reloading the page. Before this addition anything that needed to change on a webpage would have to be requested via reloading the page.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>One quote I feel sums up the pro's of Javascript: "In short, JavaScript is quickly becoming not just the ideal language for the web, but indeed a big composition of the web itself. The future of the web looks bright, and perhaps more importantly free for developers everywhere."

				<h1 class="topic_header">Only human:the limitations</h1>
				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p>The saying we're only human refers to the impossibilty of being 100% perfect, neither is javascript and like the rest of the popular kids it comes with some flaws</p>
				<p>There are two main issues with Javascript that are somewhat limiting:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>There are security issues.<br>Malicious code can be executed due to the fact that Javascript code is run on the users computer.</li>
						<li>The rendering can vary.<br>Different browsers may render Javascript differently meaning an inconsistency in the interface and functionality. Ideally there needs to be a universal standard and these are being worked towards but variations still do exist.</li>
					</ul>
