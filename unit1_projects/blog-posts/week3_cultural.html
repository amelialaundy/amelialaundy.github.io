				<h1 class="topic_header">What is my thinking style?</h1>
				<p>Anthony Gregorc divised the gregorc Thinking Styles model involving 4 different styles of thinking: concrete sequential CS, concrete random CR, abstract random AR and abstract sequential AS. </p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>CS thinkers are people who like to process ordered and sequential information</li>
						<li>CR thinkers are experimenters</li>
						<li>AR thinkers prefer unstructure environments, enjoy working with people and often organize information through reflection</li>
						<li>AS thinkers are a little more theoretical or abstract in thought</li>
					</ul>
					After taking the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">test</a> my results came back in a points form of:
					<ul>
						<li>CS 24 points</li>
						<li>CR 66 points</li>
						<li>AR 54 points</li>
						<li>AS 18 points</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>The highest number represents how you most often process information. I found this quite interesting as my two highest were in the random in category. Random refers to your ordering ability; you organize information by chunks, not in any particular order which may result in the ability of skipping steps and still ending up at the result. Random may also denote people who are more impulsive and enjoy it that way rather than organising or planning, even working backwards from the end may appeal.<!--mainly concrete random, with abstract random, very little sequential of either abstract or concrete--></p>
				<p>Concrete Random was the my highest category, so what does this mean according to Gregorc?</p>

			<p>So does this mean that this is how I am, and how I will always be? Can I resign myself to being an independant problem solver who likes to compete and won't stick to a routine for writing formal reports with only one answer?!
				<!--What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? --></p>
			<p>The short answer is no! of course not. I recognise myself from the above list and realise that whilst a lot of these are strengths, they also might open up to some weaknesses such as if I like to compete with others, is this always appropriate? Or the fact that enjoying working alone doesn't mean that that work will produce the best solution.</p>
			<p>My biggest struggle in Phase 0 so far has been finding a time block to take some time out! I have locked myself in my room from after work until late at night consistently trying to get as much work done as possible before I start work the next day. I think this reflects the independent aspect of my thinking style, where I will just plough on through and try out challenges rather than work through certain information first.</p>
			<p>Another struggle has been to stay engaged whilst reading pages of information, I find myself scrolling down the page after a minute just to see how much more writing there is left to read! This I think shows the trial and error preference, I find reading a little disengaging as it's not actually giving me the opportunity to do exactly that-get into the hard code and give it a whirl.</p>

				<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
				<p></p>
				<p>In reference to Growth vs Fixed Mindset I found an awesome quote:<br>"it(grownth mindset) creates a passion for learning rather than a hunger for approval(fixed mindset)."<br>I just thought that was a very succinct way to some up the difference between the two mindsets. I'll explain them in brief; someone with a growth mindset believes in developed intelligence, they have a desire to learn and will learn from failing as a result of embracing challenges. On the other hand someone with a fixed mindset believes that intelligence is predetermined and static, it doesn't grow or adjust. This means that failing isn't really an option for these people as it disproves their 'given' intelligence nor are obstacles, as failing at these would be the same thing, so obstacles are avoided incase of failure.
					<!--ways to broaden my style of learning & thinking--></p>
				<p>To learn effctively I would like to build upon my growth mindset and make use of extra material, 'reading around the subject' if you would, as this will only make my desire to learn stronger. I will continue to experiment with the challenges and content (rather than reading it all first to get the challenges done after) as I can learn a lot from any failures or mishaps here, but I will endeavour to give the readings more of a go, perhaps do some meditation beforehand to improve my concentration.</p>
