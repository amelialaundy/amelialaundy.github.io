				<h1 class="topic_header">What is my thinking style?</h1>
				<p>Anthony Gregorc divised the gregorc Thinking Styles model involving 4 different styles of thinking: concrete sequential CS, concrete random CR, abstract random AR and abstract sequential AS. </p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>CS thinkers are people who like to process ordered and sequential information</li>
						<li>CR thinkers are experimenters</li>
						<li>AR thinkers prefer unstructure environments, enjoy working with people and often organize information through reflection</li>
						<li>AS thinkers are a little more theoretical or abstract in thought</li>
					</ul>
					After taking the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">test</a> my results came back in a points form of:
					<ul>
						<li>CS 24 points</li>
						<li>CR 66 points</li>
						<li>AR 54 points</li>
						<li>AS 18 points</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>The highest number represents how you most often process information. I found this quite interesting as my two highest were in the random in category. Random refers to your ordering ability; you organize information by chunks, not in any particular order which may result in the ability of skipping steps and still ending up at the result. Random may also denote people who are more impulsive and enjoy it that way rather than organising or planning, even working backwards from the end may appeal.<!--mainly concrete random, with abstract random, very little sequential of either abstract or concrete--></p>
				<p>Concrete Random was the my highest category, so what does this mean according to Gregorc?</p>
