			<p>Having watched <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014"> Kitchen vs. Table</a> I am taking the time to consider what I think about EDA so far, what my impression is of the EDA experience, how I see myself engaging in this culture and what any expectations might be.</p>

				<img class="blog_images" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2909/14366035715_560dd0f426_o.jpg" alt="EDA homepage"><!--insert images-->
				<p>EDA seems to me to be a very fluid, moving and changeable experience. The main feeling I keep repeatedly having is that you can act and react how you see fit, there isn't a specific 'this is how you do this" or "this is how you're going to study" approach. So far during phase zero this is the one thing I keep relaying to myself if I start wondering have I done enough? are others taking it on the same way as I am? is that this is how I am approaching it, someone else is doing it their way, but we can all see what each other are doing/accomplishing and that it's different (and awesome) for everyone!</p>
				<p>The impression I am building of EDA is that it is a very honest environment; honest with yourself and with others, but also EDA being honest with you. In Shereef's video he mentions that phase one <em>will</em> be hard, full on and intense, but that this is not what it should be like in the work place after EDA, also that no matter what level you perceive everyone else to be at, we are all a the very beginning of a very long (and excting) journey-we will not be experienced or crazy amazing developers after graduation. This does bring you back down to earth, in a positive way, again with the honesty I don't feel you are being lulled into a false sense that EDA is a means to an end, to get you the information and for that to get you a job.</p>

			<img class="blog_images" src="" alt=""><!--insert images-->
			<p>I believe the culture of EDA will be very beneficial to my academic and personal learning, I love to ask questions, talk to others about problems and ultimately solve those problems. I am more of an extrovert than an introvert so really can't wait to start pairing and exchanging thoughts/ideas as mentioned by Shereef. Overall I'm feeling totally geared up to get my teeth into the content right now and can't wait to start phase one!</p>

				<h1 class="topic_header">Expectations of EDA</h1>
				<img class="blog_images" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5585/14179536607_432439fb22_o.jpg" alt="So much stuff going on!!"><!--insert images-->
				<p>Just an example of how much stuff I'm trying to wrap my head around...so many tabs of so many programs open I'm afraid to turn off my computer and forget where they all are!!</p>
				<p>I don't really think my expectations have changed much from listening to Shereef, although it did reinforce my current understandings of what EDA is about. I would hope not to have too many expectations specifically, rather just to be aware that it will be hard, exciting, rewarding, challenging and awesome all at the ame time and at different times!</p>
				<p> The only qualm I am currently experiencing is the workload, I already feel my knowledge has grown exponentially this week-and that's still with a pretty big list of 'to-do's from prep work last week through to the next two sections of week one to complete!-but as I find myself starting to think in code and understand more and more what I am doing I hope that worry will lessen.</p>
