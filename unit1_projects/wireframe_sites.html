			<p>As mentioned previously in the <a href="http://amelialaundy.github.io/unit1_projects/blog-posts/week1_technical">technical blog</a> Serengeti Lion project is trying to educate people on the plight of the lions, to in affect prevent them from becoming an extinct species. The problem has been shared not ony its own but by National Geographic, therefore there is already a huge audience for NG's website and so in turn produces a higher level of traffic straight to The Serengeti Project.</p>
			<p>The visual challenge of this page seems to be getting enough information in the right places without cluttering th page or taking away from its main material-the images and videos. I have tried to draw wireframe myself by hand before using wirify on the website as I found this page pretty hard to evaluate and back engineer:</p>

			<p>Following the hand drawn evaluation this is what wirify produced of the same page:</p>

			<p>I feel I don't quite understand the wireframe of this particular website as it is especially unique with alot of video and imagery as the main focus</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/" target="_blank">The Verge</a></p>
			<p>On evaulation of the problem The Verge tries to solve I consider its aim is to engage people in news of specific areas, perhaps in an alternate way to other mainstream reporting companys such as those on TV or physical material-newspapers and their websites. On the 'About' section they state: "Its mission is to offer in-depth reporting and long-form feature stories, breaking news coverage, product information, and community content in a unified and cohesive manner."</p>
			<p>Visual challenges of this website include just the sheer volume of information the website holds and gathers on a daily basis, meaning the archives are growing almost by the hour and trying to present the most important (trending, widely reported, or even under reported elsewhere) information in a visually cohesive manner without making the website too busy or overloading the user with images/videos/headlines. Again I have taken to hand drawing a wireframe before retrieving the wirify version:</p>

			<p>On reflection this is not dissimilar to what wirify creates, although for this particular website for some reason wirify leaves some of the imagery partly over the top of the wireframe..something for me to figure out why!</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/home" target="_blank">StumpleUpon</a>
			<p>StumbleUpon aims to provide a solution to people wanting more knowledge and information about anything and everything they are interested in, from sports to design to travel, literally everyone can find content on their interests. This is what StumbleUpon have to say themselves: "StumbleUpon is great for finding you content you might never have otherwise found on your own."</p>
			<p>Having external content presenting within the body of the website might create visual problems such as getting the selected website of interest to display correctly within the parameters of StumbleUpon's own website. Other than this they need to keep the home page with reccomendations very clean and clear, not unlike the verge, to keep the user from being overloaded. Finally to follow is my hand drawn interpretation of the wireframe and the one I have grabbed using wirify:</p>
