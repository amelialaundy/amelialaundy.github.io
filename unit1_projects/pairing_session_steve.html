                <p>The main concepts of pairing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pairing allows two people to work together on code with one instructing and the other typing</li>
                    <li>The roles do change throughout the session to give each person time directing the code and typing the code</li>
                    <li>Pairing can be done in person on one workstation or remotely, as we have for this page, via google hangouts and using <a href="https://code.stypi.com/">Stypi</a> website to collaborate on the same document of code</li>
                </ul>

            <p id="first_paragraph" class="marginleft-right">There may be many benefits to peer pairing, some for the code itself and others for the people involved.</p>
            <p>In terms of the code benefitting, Wikipedia claims that 'Pairs spend about 15% more time on programs than individuals. However, the resulting code has about 15% fewer defects.' thus two people can spot more errors than one working on their own. The 15% more time spent may cost a company employing them more in wages but the greatly decreased number of bugs in the code, that would normally require more expenditure to fix, results in less expenditure overall.</p>
            <p>Another benefit would be that working together reinforces peoples relationships and makes for having a stronger communicative team. Pairing requires constant communication about every thought each has with the code, patience as well may play a part when listening to someone's idea that you might not agree with.</p>
            <p>Pairing naturally leads to each person involved learning more skills from design to programming rules, this is what every programmer is aiming to do: learn more to grow more and create better code.</p>

                <h2>Driver</h2>
            
                <p>The driver writes the code into the document whilst listening to the navigator who will direct them to the exact code they want to go in the document.</p>

                <h2>Navigator</h2>
            
                <p>The navigator considers the code and instructs the driver on what to write, much like rally driving where the driver relies solely on the directions from the navigator in the passenger seat and won't make a turn unless it has been verbalised by the navigator.</p>

                <h2>Reflection:</h2>
                    <p>Amelia:<br>I really enjoyed this first pairing session with Steve, we started by having a brief chat before the guided session started. I think this really helped as we could gauge where each other were, this was especially helpful for me to know where Steve was as he has only just started the course and so playing catch up. This meant I could check where he had got to, what he may or may not have covered yet etc.</p>
                    <p> During the remote wireframing we communicated well, and considered different factors of the design. The same goes for the coding session, we worked well with Steve as the navigator-writing the code, and myself driving.</p>
                    <p>I don't think anything didn't work, of course we had a few issues with how do we write this? or where should this go? but in terms of the actual pairing experience I think it went smoothly.
