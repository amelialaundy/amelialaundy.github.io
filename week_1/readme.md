## Remember your Expectations for the Unit!
- Give feedback for each person you paired with. *You need to submit at least 5 pieces of feedback in this unit*
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) on Socrates. *You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit*
- Make sure you've signed up for GPS 1.1 and 1.2 (Email invites will go out during the week; These must be done in a session with guide. They may not be done any other way, so make sure you sign up early!)

## Submitting your work
You need to submit your work through by Sunday at 11:59pm. 

Towards the end of each week, you will receive a link with a form to fill-in to submit links to your Github repository and files. If you haven't completed all the assignments by the end of the week please email your Phase 0 Facilitator to let them know.

Expect to submit your links for each of the following:

* Your new website ([USERNAME].github.io)
* Each html page created in `unit1_projects` folder
* Your forked `phase_0_unit_1` repository link
* Your technical and cultural blog posts (on your github.io ste)
* Your response to "getting to know your group" 

NOTE: You will have two separate repositories in Github for Unit 1: Your Github.io site and your phase_0_unit_1 repository. Most of your work will be on the [USERNAME].github.io repo, but the reflections will be submitted through the phase_0_unit_1 repo.

## Fetching changes from EDA's repo
Sometimes we will make changes to the original repository to clarify instructions or add new curriculum. You will need to "fetch" these changes from the master branch when we announce changes on the google+ community. Follow [these](https://github.com/kereru-2014/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/fetching_changes.md) directions to do this. If you are using a windows or linux, you will need to use the command line instructions.
